# Worker Code

## Installation

Clone repository.
Navigate to directory.
Run npm install
Run node main.js for solutions to question 1, 2, and 3.
To change the file that you run the solutions on just edit the path in main.js
Run npm test to see test results.

## Assumptions

- Solution will only work on data that is in 15 minute increments (e.g. 00, 15, 30, 45).
- Solution will only work if workers time slots don't overlap (e.g. 2:00 to 4:00 and 3:00 to 5:00)
- Solution works with the assumption that the file used is valid and the data within the file is valid. For example:
- Start dates are before the end date. Data is formatted in file correctly.

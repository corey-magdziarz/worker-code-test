# Worker Code

## Installation

Clone repository.
Navigate to directory.
Run npm install
Run node main.js for solutions to question 1, 2, and 3.
Run npm test to see test results.

## Assumptions

- Solution will only work on data that is in 15 minute increments (e.g. 00, 15, 30, 45).
- Solution will only work if workers time slots don't overlap (e.g. 2:00 to 4:00 and 3:00 to 5:00)
